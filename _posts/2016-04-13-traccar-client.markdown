Traccar Client is an app that allows you to use your mobile device as a GPS tracker. It reports location to your own or hosted server with selected time intervals.
By default application is configured to use free Traccar service (address - demo.traccar.org, port - 5055). You must change the address from "demo.traccar.org" on "web.erlymon.org".  To see your device on map register on http://web.erlymon.org/ and add your device with identifier.
