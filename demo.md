Demo server is a fully-featured instance of Erlymon which you can use to track your GPS devices or phones. Correct ports for your device can be found here. There are no limits on number of devices.

There is no pre defined demo user or demo data. You need to register your own account by clicking on “Register” button on the login screen. To get some data you can use Traccar Client app for on your smartphone [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.traccar.client) or [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/traccar-client/id843156974).

I cannot guarantee the quality of service, but I am trying my best to keep your GPS data safe.
